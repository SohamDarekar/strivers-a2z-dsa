# A2Z DSA Journey

This repository contains my solutions and notes from the [A2Z DSA Course by Striver](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgUwDviBIf0oF6QL8m22w1hIDC1vJ_BHz).  
The purpose of this repository is to strengthen my foundations in Data Structures and Algorithms through structured practice.

## About the Course
The A2Z DSA playlist provides a roadmap covering:
- Basics of programming and mathematics
- Arrays, Strings, Recursion
- Sorting and Searching
- Linked List, Stack, Queue
- Trees, Graphs, Heap
- Dynamic Programming and advanced topics

## Tech Stack
- Language: C++
- Platform: YouTube (Striver’s Playlist) and practice platforms such as LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and CodeStudio
